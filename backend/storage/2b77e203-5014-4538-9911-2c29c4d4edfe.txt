Advantages of using digital communication over analog 
communication  
 
Can combine different signal types – data, voice, text, image, 
video etc.  
 
Data communication in computers is digital in nature 
whereas voice communication between people is analog in 
nature  
 
The two different types (data/voice/text/image/video) of 
signal communication are difficult to combine over the same 
medium in the analog domain.  
 
Using digital techniques, it is possible to combine both format 
for transmission through a common medium.  
 
Encryption and privacy techniques are easier to implement 
 
Better overall performance

Digital communication is inherently more efficient than analog in 
realizing the exchange of SNR for bandwidth.  
 
Digital signals can be coded to yield extremely low rates and high 
fidelity as well as privacy. 
Hardware is more flexible  
 
Digital hardware implementation is flexible and permits the use 
of microprocessors, mini-processors, digital switching and VLSI  
 
Shorter design and production cycle  
 
Low cost: The use of LSI and VLSI in the design of components 
and systems have resulted in lower cost  
 
Easier and more efficient to multiplex several digital signals  
 
Easier and more efficient Multiple Access Technique like TDMA, 
FDMA, CDMA etc.

Challenges in Digital Communications 
 Requires reliable “synchronization”  
Requires A/D conversions at high rate 
 Requires larger bandwidth

Performance Metrics 
•
Analog Communication Systems 
– Metric is fidelity: want  
– SNR typically used as performance metric 
 
 
•
Digital Communication Systems 
– Metrics are data rate (R bps) and probability of bit error  (BER) 
 
 
– Symbols already known at the receiver 
– Without noise/distortion/sync. problem, we will never make bit 
errors
