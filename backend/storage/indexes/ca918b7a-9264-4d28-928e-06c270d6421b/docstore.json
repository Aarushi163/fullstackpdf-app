AI is an interdisciplinary\nscience\nwith multiple approaches, but advancements in machine learning and deep learning are creating a\nparadigm\nshift in virtually every sector of the tech industry.\nApplications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition,\nand machine vision. AI systems are powered by algorithms, using techniques such as machine\nlearning\nand rules. Machine learning is a subset of AI that includes statistical methods that enable machines\nto improve with experience.\nAI is used in various industries including healthcare, finance, education, transportation, and more.\nIn healthcare, AI helps in diagnosis, personalized treatment, and even surgery assistance. In\nfinance,\nAI is used for fraud detection, investment predictions, and customer service automation.\nWhile AI offers significant advantages, it also poses challenges such as job displacement,\nethical concerns, and data privacy issues. Researchers and policymakers are working to create\nregulations and best practices to ensure AI technologies are used responsibly.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1293, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/metadata": {"7ae967dc-7be3-4ff0-be0f-90037063a119": {"doc_hash": "6e9f8bb148d1a02a8072662289c1db3f7b8cb167fe4bb2ea8e14c47c7b5fcdaa", "ref_doc_id": "31e97ade-1a3f-4b20-a3bf-1802f2c63ddc"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"31e97ade-1a3f-4b20-a3bf-1802f2c63ddc": {"node_ids": ["7ae967dc-7be3-4ff0-be0f-90037063a119"], "metadata": {"doc_id": "ca918b7a-9264-4d28-928e-06c270d6421b"}}}}
